# FLAKYRANK
## A Ranking Framework for Predicting FLAKY Tests

Welcome to FLAKYRANK, an open-source project designed to address the challenges of dealing with FLAKY tests in software testing. FLAKYRANK offers a comprehensive ranking framework that helps you identify and manage FLAKY test cases effectively.

### Why FLAKY Tests?
FLAKY tests are a common challenge in software testing, as they produce inconsistent results across test runs, making it difficult to distinguish real defects from sporadic issues. FLAKYRANK aims to tackle this problem by providing a ranking framework that helps prioritize these problematic tests.

### Repository Structure
The FLAKYRANK repository is organized into different directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- `pointwise`: This directory contains code related to the pointwise ranking method. Pointwise ranking ranks test cases individually based on their FLAKY characteristics. You can explore this directory for algorithms and tools specific to pointwise ranking.

- `pairwise`: The `pairwise` directory houses code and resources related to the pairwise ranking method. Pairwise ranking involves comparing test cases in pairs to determine their relative FLAKY behavior. You'll find code and tools for this method in this directory.

- `listwise`: In the `listwise` directory, you'll discover code and resources associated with the listwise ranking method. Listwise ranking ranks test cases as a group, considering their collective FLAKY attributes. This directory contains algorithms and tools tailored for listwise ranking.

- `data_framework`: The `data_framework` directory is where you'll find the dataset used by FLAKYRANK for training and testing its ranking models. It includes various attributes and features of FLAKY tests, along with essential ranking information. Additionally, this directory contains code for data preprocessing and feature engineering to ensure high-quality data.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
To effectively rank FLAKY tests, FLAKYRANK leverages a range of machine learning algorithms, including, but not limited to:

- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Multilayer Perceptron
- K-Nearest Neighbor
- RankNet
- SVMRank
- Listwise
- LambdaMART

These algorithms can be tailored to your specific needs, providing optimal ranking performance.
